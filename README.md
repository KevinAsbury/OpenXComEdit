# OpenXcomEdit

OpenXcomEdit is a .Net app for editing Open Xcom save files.

# Description

What can it do?  In it's current state the app can open most OpenXcom UFO save files. I haven't finished capturing all the save game states but that is high on my priority list. The program will let you edit your base layout, edit important soldier stats, and let you edit units on a mission (that includes the aliens and civilians). You can also view and edit the raw save file (it's in the YAML format) if you feel confident.

In the future I would like to be able to edit the general stores inventory, edit craft, edit funding, and other aspects of the game. 

Farther down line I will add the ability to edit OpenXcom TFTD save files as well.

Check it out in the releases section or build it yourself!
